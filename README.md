This is a Jupyter notebook that highlights the use of AWS Rekognition's facial identification functionality.  It will identify celebrity faces (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/celebrity-recognition.html) and use the Movie Graph Database (https://neo4j.com/developer/movie-database/#_download) hosted in a Neo4J instance to render a graphical representation of the relationship between two celebrities (ala Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon).
